# Bayesian Color Segmentation
This work features a Bayesian color based segmentation algorithm for digital image processing using OpenCV. The main goal is to develop an algorithm capable of separating visual regions of an image for further processing. Color segmentation can be useful in many tasks, such as extracting skin colored pixels for face or gestures detection.
